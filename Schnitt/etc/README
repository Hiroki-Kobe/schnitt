Try:
- Inno Setup http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
- NSIS http://nsis.sourceforge.net/A_slightly_better_Java_Launcher



Steps
1. CLI run
   run from cli: program, with installed java
   
2. portable JRE
   run from cli: progarm, with custom java 
    - used "jPortable" to get a portable java (for win)
    - setup manifest (if needed) in pom.xml
    - if time
   minimize JRE (it is 150MB now)
    - not all classes are needed
    - Packr  -> did not really work...
     
3. create installer NSIS
