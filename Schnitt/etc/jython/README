  - no training algorithms are implemented
    -> use external tools (Mathematica - asked Peter)
  - features have to come from Java libraries
    -> using other feature-extracting tool for training is error prone
    -> chance for different features between this library and other tools
  - Solution: jython 
    - feature extraction
    - possibly scipython for training
  - Steps
    - create uber-jar (with all dependencies involved)
    - create jython that loads schnitt-related libraries, natives (lwjgl:OpenAL) if needed
